> If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

## Background

This project is based on Felix Krause's "mood" - go check out his inspiring projects at [https://krausefx.com/](https://krausefx.com/)

Understanding what makes us happy is no easy task. In the past decades a substanial amount of research has been made on this subject, however research can provide us with general guidelines at best.

We wanted to create a way to track our overall happiness and excitement in my life, allowing us to monitor, analyze and react to it. Think of it as a psychological happiness research that is tailor made for you and how you experience your life.

## How it works

It's a simple [Telegram Bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that will send you a message 3 times a day:

- One in the morning (I'd never reply to the bot before showering)
- One after lunch
- One when going to bed

You can always just text your bot a number, however, I know I'd forget it. That's why the bot sends you those reminders.

It then pulls up this really nice, optimized keyboard in Telegram, with a short description of what each number means.

## Graphs

We're working on a nice visualization page & dashboard for this. Maybe even just send a weekly and monthly summary via Telegram?

Right now, just send `/graph` to your bot to get your historic mood as a simple graph.

## How to use it

Super easy!

- Add the bot - [http://t.me/FeelikeBot](http://t.me/FeelikeBot)
- Send '/start'

That's it!

We're exited to get your feedback so write to us!
Also, contributions are super welcome :)
